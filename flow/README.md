## Flow based models
To understand flow based models u need to be good at solving differential equations. if you know the following topics, then u are good to go, if not keep your LLMs at work and brush up. 
- Differential equations
    - what are differential equations?
    - slope fields and reason for existence.
    - How to solve differential equations analytically?
    - Euler's method to solve differential equations 
    - RK1 method to solve DE
    - Adapative methods to solve DE 
- Probability and distributions
    - Random variables.
    - kernel density estimation
    - CDF and PDF of a probability distribution
    - maximum likelihood estimation
    - change of variables. 
- Calculus 
    - solving integrals
    - Gradients and does it represent.
    - vector fields 
    - directional derivatives 
    - divergence 
    - curl 
    - flux 
    - stokes theorm
    - green's theorm
