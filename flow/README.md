## Papers 
These are the following papers to read. I m wondering how I missed some of these papers all these years and also wondering what else I m missing. 

- [NICE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.8516)
- [REALNVP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.08803)
- [GLOW](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03039)
- [Rectified Flow](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.03003)
